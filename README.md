# C Programming

This branch is where my coding journey truly begins — with the language that teaches you to think like a machine and debug like a detective.

Here, you'll find all my university coursework related to **C programming**: neatly organized labs, assignments, and small projects that reflect the ups, downs, and deep dives into memory, logic, and control flow. From writing my first `printf()` to battling with pointers and segmentation faults, this is where the foundation is laid.

Each folder tells a small part of the story — a story of learning to write code that speaks the language of the machine.
