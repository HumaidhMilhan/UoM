# 🎓 University Coding Archive

Welcome to my University Coding Archive – a collection of all the programming projects, assignments, and experiments I've worked on throughout my academic journey.

## 🌐 About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal archive and showcase of the code I've written during my time at university. From foundational concepts to complex projects, every line of code here tells a story of learning, problem-solving, and growth.

### 📁 Structure

- Each **branch** in this repository represents a different **programming language** or **course**.
- Within each branch, you'll find **folders** for individual **assignments**, **projects**, or **labs**.
- Code is organized cleanly and consistently to make it easy to revisit, review, or build upon in the future.

### 🛠️ Technologies Covered

Depending on the branch, this repo may include work in:
- C / C++
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript
- HTML / CSS
- SQL
- And more as I continue learning...

### 🎯 Purpose

This repository is more than just a backup—it's a personal log of progress, a place to reflect on how far I’ve come, and a space to share the coding journey with others. It also serves as a reference point for future work or collaboration.

## 📌 Note

This code is written as part of academic learning. While some pieces may be polished, others reflect the iterative nature of learning—bugs, breakthroughs, and all.
